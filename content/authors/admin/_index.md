<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a clinical psychologist, psychotherapist and assistant professor at the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Bucharest. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Bucharest with an interdisciplinary thesis on Psycho-Oncology, which encompassed studies on epidemiology, intervention targeting, intervention development and psychotherapy process-research. Currently, I work as a postdoctoral fellow at the International Center for Research and Education in Creative Technologies (CINETic) collaborating in the MET and STAD projects. My day-to-day tasks focus on psychometric test development, computerized tasks, and psychological and psychophysiology data analysis.
